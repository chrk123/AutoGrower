# AutoGrower

Simple Arduino project based on platformio.

Goal of this project is to control two different relays based on temperature and soil moisture. Each of these relays has an appropriate device attached:
- heatmat
- a small 5V pump

Current temperature and soil moisture is displayed using a lcd display attached to an i2c controller.
